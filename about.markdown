Hello, I'm Andrei Nicu, a Software Engineer based in London with a passion for cloud-native technologies, infrastructure automation, and building resilient systems.
With over a decade of experience in the tech industry, I've specialized in developing scalable test frameworks for complex telecommunication systems and APIs across multi-cloud environments. My work at Ericsson, Vonage, and other leading tech companies has allowed me to dive deep into AWS and GCP ecosystems, master container orchestration with Kubernetes and Nomad, and implement infrastructure as code using Terraform and CloudFormation.

## My Expertise
My professional journey has been focused on bridging the gap between software development and infrastructure, with particular emphasis on:

* Architected multi-cloud testing frameworks for network APIs
* Implementing cloud-native testing strategies
* Optimizing CI/CD pipelines for faster delivery
* Creating chaos testing environments to enhance application resiliency
* Developing performance and security testing solutions

As a Certified Kubernetes Administrator and Application Developer with a strong networking background (Cisco CCNP), I bring a holistic perspective to solving complex technical challenges in distributed systems.

## Personal Life
I live in Surbiton, South West London with my wife and two children. Outside of technology, I'm an avid sci-fi reader who's always looking for the next great novel to dive into. To stay active, I enjoy playing football and basketball with friends, as well as keeping fit with functional training. These activities provide the perfect balance to my technical work and help me maintain perspective and creativity.
I started this blog to share insights, best practices, and lessons learned throughout my career in cloud and software engineering. Whether you're a seasoned professional or just beginning your journey in tech, I hope you'll find valuable content here that helps you navigate the ever-evolving landscape of cloud technologies.
